# Python 3 scripts template

This is a basic nix flake used for python3 development. If you want to write a
quick script that you'd inline in a CloudFormation template, or just want to
quickly invoke from CLI - then just pasting it here in script.py and opening it
in your favorite text editor with LSP is a great strategy.

Hoping you've got [nix installed](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Nix_Installation_Guide#Single-user_install),
preferably with [direnv](https://github.com/nix-community/nix-direnv) support.

**NOTE**: github actions are disabled by default.
